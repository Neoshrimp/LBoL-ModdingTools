#### Quick Localization Reload
[*Download*](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Neoshrimp/LBoL-ModdingTools/master/src/QuickReloadLoc/QuickReloadLoc.dll)

**Important:** depending on which localization option a mod is using, the game might need to be restarted for newly created .yaml files to be picked up.
Afterwards, changes in .yaml files are reloaded normally.

Adds button and hotkey (default: `L`, configurable in .cfg) for quickly reloading current localization.

Useful for reloading localization files very quickly when modding or translating.
